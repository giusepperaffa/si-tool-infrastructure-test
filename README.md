# Serverless Inspector Tool - Test Repository
Repository used by the [Serverless Inspector Tool](https://github.com/giusepperaffa/serverless-inspector-tool) in **infrastructure** code test mode.

It contains a collection of Python files obtained by mapping into Python dictionaries YAML files from the [Serverless Framework examples](https://www.serverless.com/examples/) (AWS only).

Since the Python files were generated out of YAML files, these are also included in the folder [yaml](yaml).
